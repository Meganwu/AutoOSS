# Auto_Reaction_STM
We develop a deep reinforcement learning approach to automate chemical reactions (breaking C-Br) in scanning probe microscopy. It comprises the remote connection, path planning module, image and signal process and classification module, reinforcement learning framework to find optimal policy to achieve goals.
